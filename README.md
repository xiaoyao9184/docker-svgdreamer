# Docker SVGDreamer

A Docker image built through Github Actions with Git commit version tag

[![Docker Image Build/Publish tag with commit](https://github.com/xiaoyao9184/docker-svgdreamer/actions/workflows/docker-image-tag-commit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/xiaoyao9184/docker-svgdreamer/actions/workflows/docker-image-tag-commit.yml) [![](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/xiaoyao9184/svgdreamer)](https://hub.docker.com/r/xiaoyao9184/svgdreamer)

# Why

I found that [SVGDreamer](https://github.com/ximinng/SVGDreamer)’s Docker image needs to install dependencies at runtime, so I reimplemented this version.

This project will use GitHub Actions and Docker Hub to build and publish images,
aiming to keep the process as clean as possible without custom configuration files.

# Tags

The images of this project will be published to Docker Hub under the repository [xiaoyao9184/svgdreamer](https://hub.docker.com/r/xiaoyao9184/svgdreamer).

Since this project references the SVGDreamer project via a submodule, it cannot monitor push events on the SVGDreamer project, and therefore cannot automatically create an image for every commit.
A good solution is to manually trigger the action and tag it with the commit id. For more details, see this article [set-dynamic-parameters-github-workflows-en](https://damienaicheh.github.io/github/actions/2022/01/20/set-dynamic-parameters-github-workflows-en.html).

The default image name format is `${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/svgdreamer`.

The tag uses the input parameter `commit_id`,
which can be either a branch name or a commit id,
when manually triggering the [docker-image-tag-commit](./.github/workflows/docker-image-tag-commit.yml) job.
if the job is triggered by a submodule update push,
the default branch name `main` will be used instead of the `commit_id` parameter.
This job will also use the shortened commit id as the tag.

Currently, only the `linux/amd64` platform is supported.

# Model

The Docker image does not include model files.
When running, the required models will be automatically downloaded.

If you need to run offline, you must pre-download the model files and enable offline mode.
See [cache/README.md](./cache/README.md) for detailed instructions.

# Service

By default, the Docker container runs the Gradio app, which comes from the original project.

# Change

You can fork this project and build your own image. You will need to provide the following variables: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`, `HF_USERNAME`, `HF_TOKEN`.
See [this](https://github.com/docker/login-action#docker-hub) for more details.
